"C1, C2",Capacitor,1206,4.7μF,https://www.digikey.com/short/p2pnd5,$0.50,"Bulk power supply decoupling capacitors. 2.2μF - 10μF is probably fine, prefer X5/X7 ceramic capacitors with low ESR."
"C2, C3",Capacitor,0805,5pF,https://www.digikey.com/short/p2pnrf,$0.20,"Filtering capacitors for the 32.768KHz low-speed crystal oscillator. The actual value depends on your crystal, but it will probably be between 0-15pF and isn't hugely important. Prefer C0G/NP0 ceramic capacitors."
C5,Capacitor,0805,100nF,https://www.digikey.com/short/p2pnw5,$0.10,Decoupling capacitor for the only power pair of supply pins on the QFP32 STM32G031 package. Prefer X5/X7 ceramic capacitors.
C6,Capacitor,0805,10nF,https://www.digikey.com/short/p2pn24,$0.10,"Filtering capacitor for the reset button. This is recommended by ST's application notes. Although, I wonder - should there also be a resistor in series between the reset pin and the button?"
D1,Schottky Diode,1206,"20-40V, 0.5-2A",https://www.digikey.com/short/p2pnv4,$0.40,"Schottky diode to protect against reverse polarity. This will probably introduce a ~0.3-0.6V drop before the voltage regulator, but it should prevent the circuit from frying if you swap + and - by accident."
D2,LED,1206,Your favorite color,https://www.digikey.com/short/p2pdmb,$0.20,"Heartbeat' LED - it's nice for a board to include at least one LED for a program to use. Also, the QFP32 STM32G031 includes a single pin from the GPIOC bank, which is nice for this sort of thing. I think that you aren't supposed to sink more than 20mA from each bank, so using pin C6 to drive an LED doesn't limit what we can do on the GPIOA or GPIOB banks."
"J1, J2",Pin Header or Socket Row,"0.1""",1x15,https://www.digikey.com/short/p2pdvt,$0.74,"These are generic parts, and you can find them much more cheaply on eBay, Amazon, AliExpress, etc. You can usually get good deals on bunches of 1x40 rows, and cut them to size."
R1,Resistor,1206,1KΩ,https://www.digikey.com/short/p2p0ht,$0.10,"If you want to use PWM to drive the LED, maybe 220-470Ω would be better. If you want it to be dim, maybe 4.7KΩ-10KΩ? Red/yellow LEDs will be brighter than green/blue/white LEDs for the same value of resistance, because their forward voltages are lower."
SW1,Button,"0.45""x0.45""",SPST,https://www.digikey.com/short/p2p09q,$0.22,"I picked the 'TL3305A' part because it was reasonably cheap and in the default KiCAD footprint library. But any old 4-leg SMD 0.45""x0.45"" tactile button will probably work."
U1,Microcontroller,LQFP-32,STM32G031Kx,https://www.digikey.com/short/p2p05b,$1.86,"The core MCU. Be sure to double-check where pin #1 goes - look in the datasheet for the 'pin 1' marking location. There are currently two versions available; the one ending in 'K6' is cheaper, but only has 32KB of Flash memory. The one ending in 'K8' has 64KB Flash."
U2,Voltage Regulator,SOT-23,AP2210-3.3,https://www.digikey.com/short/p2p090,$0.42,"I like this voltage regulator because it only has 3 pins, it can supply a decent 300mA, and it works with up to a 13V input. But I'm starting to think it's a good idea to use regulators with 'power good' pins tied to the reset line."
Y1,Crystal,2mm-Diameter,32.768KHz,https://www.digikey.com/short/p2p0b2,$0.21,"Low-Speed External' crystal oscillator. I used a cylindrical 2mm-diameter through-hole crystal because it's a very standard size, but here's an exercise for the reader - replace it with a small SMD crystal!"
Total,-,-,-,-,$5.05,"You can pay a bit less per unit if you buy in 10s or 100s, but then you'd need to make 10 or 100 of these. SMD resistors and capacitors can be worth buying in bulk, though."
