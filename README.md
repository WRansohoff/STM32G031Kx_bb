# Simple STM32G031Kx Breakout Board

This is just a simple reference circuit for a 32-pin STM32G031 microcontroller. I tried to make it easy to hand-solder, with everything on one side of the board, wide footprints, and no parts smaller than 0805. The microcontroller also has pins spaced at 0.8mm, which is farther apart than the usual <=0.5mm that you see these days. Some of the parts are a little close together, so you might have to think about the order that you solder them on if you don't reflow it. But it should be do-able without much soldering experience required.

Note: I'm still waiting on these boards to arrive, so this design is still untested. I'll update this with more information and a proper readme in a couple of weeks once I've verified that things work. Sorry for the inconvenience, in the meantime!
